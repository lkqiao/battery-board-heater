# battery-board-heater
Subproject as part of the Stanford Student Space Initiative; designed a heater circuit for the battery board of the satellite to maintain optimal temperature.

A schematic of the heater circuit provided in KiCad and is integrated into the main battery board PCB of the satellite. The coordinates of each point of the heating coil are generated by the Python script.
