# battery-board-heater
Subproject as part of the Stanford Student Space Initiative (SSI); designed a heater circuit for the battery board of SAMWISE, the satellite we are currently working on, to maintain optimal temperature.

A schematic of the heater circuit provided in KiCad and is integrated into the main battery board PCB of the satellite. Furthermore, the coordinates of each point on the heating coil are generated by the Python script.
